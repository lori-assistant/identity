# Lori: An identity for a homelab assistant

This repository contains a Modelfile which can be used to turn the `wizard-vicuna-uncensored:13b-q4_0` base model into a customized Lori model for `ollama`. Model temperature is set in favor of consistency since we want our model not only to provide code, but also have internet and file system access along with other things. The Modelfile is configured to inject the initial identity-defining prompt into the first message in the conversation.

## Modelfile
